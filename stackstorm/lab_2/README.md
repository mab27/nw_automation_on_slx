## Overview:
- Building workflows using **core.http** action to interact with the RESTCONF API of the device.
- Sections:
    - [Getters (show commands)]()
    	- [get_os_version]()
      	- [validate_interface_state]()
      	- [validate_L2_port_channel_state]()
      	- [ping]()
      	- [execute_cli (to get an arbitrary list of show commands)]()
    - [Setters (configuration commands)]()
    	- [create_acl]()
